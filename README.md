# Fashion Classification with CNN

This repository contains a project that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for fashion classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes popular libraries like Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Dataset

The [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset is a collection of grayscale images representing various fashion items. It includes:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- 10 classes of fashion items (e.g., T-shirts, trousers, and shoes)

## Project Overview

### Steps Covered
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Download and load the Fashion MNIST dataset using Keras.
   - Explore the dataset's structure and visualize sample images.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize image pixel values to improve model performance.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Create a CNN architecture using Keras' Sequential API.
   - Include layers like convolution, pooling, and dropout to enhance performance.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and metrics.
   - Train the model on the dataset and validate its performance.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset.
   - Visualize results such as accuracy and loss over epochs.

### Key Libraries Used
- **Keras**: For building and training the CNN.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations.
